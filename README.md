wfantund, Userspace Wireless Field Area Network (WFAN) Network Daemon
======================================================================

`wfantund` is derived from `wpantund` which was written and developed by
Nest Labs to make supporting [Thread](http://threadgroup.org)
connectivity on Unix-like operating systems more straightforward.

`wfantund` is a user-space network interface driver/daemon that
provides a native IPv6 network interface to TI Wi-SUN FAN Border Router
operating in Network Processor (NWP) mode. 

TI Wi-SUN FAN Solution are supported over TI CC13xx platforms.
Refer to https://www.ti.com/wireless-connectivity/wi-sun/overview.html for more details.


TI Wi-SUN FAN embedded software running on TI CC13xx platform can be downloaded
from TI CC13xx_26xx SDK (https://www.ti.com/tool/download/SIMPLELINK-CC13X2-26X2-SDK)

Software provided in this repository provides Linux Application Examples that can run over
TI Wi-SUN FAN Border Router NWP software (to be obtained from TI CC13xx_26xx SDK) connected
via UART to a Linux Platform.

These examples are meant to be serve as sample application examples to aid in development
of a Linux OS based Wi-SUN Border Router custom applications and provide back-end connectivity.

Software can be ported to other embedded Linux platforms to develop WI-SUN FAN based Border router
solution. Reference cross compilation support has been provided for TI AM64x SK Platform 
(https://www.ti.com/tool/SK-AM64).


`wfantund` is designed to marshall all access to the NCP, ensuring
that it always remains in a consistent and well-defined state.

## Compilation and Installation ##

### Linux OS (Ubuntu) Support ###
Refer to Install.md for compiling and installing `wfantund` and `wfanctl` 
in Ubuntu Linux OS.

### Embedded Linux OS Support ###
Refer to Install_AM64x_sk.md for cross-compiling and installing `wfantund` and `wfanctl` 
for TI AM64x SK (https://www.ti.com/tool/SK-AM64).

## Usage Overview ##

The behavior of `wfantund` is determined by its configuration
parameters, which may be specified in a configuration file (typically
`/etc/wpantund.conf`) or at the command line. A typical configuration
file might look like that shown below. For a more thorough explanation
of available configuration parameters, see the [included example][3].

    # Try to name the network interface `wpan0`.
    # If not possible, a different name will be used.
    Config:TUN:InterfaceName      "wfan0"

    # The pathname of the socket used to communicate
    # with the NCP.
    Config:NCP:SocketPath         "/dev/ttyUSB0"

    # The name of the driver plugin to use. The chosen
    # plugin must support the NCP you are trying to use.
    Config:NCP:DriverName         "spinel"

### Configuring and monioring wfantund using TI's webserver (Recommended) ###

TI's webserver application has been provided in the `/ti-wisun-webapp` folder. This application allows the user to easily configure the border router, monitor the health of the network, and build other applications on top of it.

**Note: Make sure to follow the installation instructions in the ti-wisun-webapp README.md for the correct npm/node versions**

This application automatically starts wfantund on detecting the border router device.

For more information, go to `/ti-wisun-webapp/README.md`

### Steps to run demo ###

* Start the webserver found in `/ti-wisun-webapp/`
* Connect one TI CC13x2R7 with TI Wi-SUN BR Image to Linux PC
* Power on one (or few) Wi-SUN FAN Router devices 
* Wi-SUN FAN Router devices will start blinking their Green LED to show that they are trying to join network
* Rate at which they blink will go down as they connect to network
* Wi-SUN Router devices will stop blinking after they join the network *(Note: It may take around 3-5 min for a node to join)*
* The webserver application can be visualized using any standard webbrowser to display the Wi-SUN FAN network as a graph
* The webserver is designed to be a foundation that higher level applications can be developed on top of

### Configuring wfantund using wfanctl (Alternate) ###

To use `wfanctl`, first start wfantund:

    sudo /usr/local/sbin/wfantund -o Config:NCP:SocketPath `<Serial Port>`
    example: sudo /usr/local/sbin/wfantund -o Config:NCP:SocketPath /dev/ttyACM0

When up and running, you can use `wfanctl` to get or set TI Wi-SUN FAN Parameters

To start wfanctl use
```
   $ sudo /usr/local/bin/wfanctl 
```
To get/set properties use the get/set command.

example:
```
   wfanctl:wfan0> get panid
   0xABCD
```

The status of TI Wi-SUN Border Router along with some other related information can be obtained using the `status` command

```
wfanctl:wfan0> status
wfan0 => [
	"NCP:State" => "offline"
	"Daemon:Enabled" => true
	"NCP:Version" => "TIWISUNFAN/1.0.1; RELEASE; Oct 28 2021 14:02:58"
	"Daemon:Version" => "0.08.00d (0.07.01-380-ge8fc63f-dirty; Nov  2 2021 20:16:55)"
	"Config:NCP:DriverName" => "spinel"
	"NCP:HardwareAddress" => [00124B0014F7D160]
	"Network:NodeType" => "0 : Border Router"
	"Network:PANID" => 0xABCD
]
```
_For detailed list of all supported TI Wi-SUN FAN Command, please refer to `ti_wisun_commands.md`_

The interface and stack can be started using the following commands
```
   $ sudo wfanctl set interface:up true
   $ sudo wfanctl set stack:up true
```

Status of Interface can be checked by using the status command.
```
wfanctl:wfan0> status
wfan0 => [
	"NCP:State" => "associated"
	"Daemon:Enabled" => true
	"NCP:Version" => "TIWISUNFAN/1.0.1; RELEASE; Oct 28 2021 14:02:58"
	"Daemon:Version" => "0.08.00d (0.07.01-380-ge8fc63f-dirty; Nov  2 2021 20:16:55)"
	"Config:NCP:DriverName" => "spinel"
	"NCP:HardwareAddress" => [00124B0014F7D160]
	"Network:NodeType" => "0 : Border Router"
	"Network:PANID" => 0xABCD
]
```
Note: `associated` in TI WI-SUN FAN Contest implies that the TI Wi-SUN FAN Border Router has started.

### Checking if tun Interface is up. ###
When the stack is up, the TUN interface will be enabled. It can be verified by checking

    $ ifconfig wfan0
    wfan0: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1280  metric 1
        inet6 fe80::212:4b00:14f7:d160  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        inet6 2020:abcd::212:4b00:14f7:d160  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>
        inet6 fe80::31b1:1233:76ab:d3e5  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>

### Checking for connected devices ###
User can check for connected devices using the connecteddevices property
```
   wfanctl:wfan0> get connecteddevices
   connecteddevices = "
   List of connected devices currently in routing table:
   2020:abcd:0000:0000:0212:4b00:14f7:d102
   2020:abcd:0000:0000:0212:4b00:14f7:d2e8`
```
### Interacting with connected devices ###
Using the TUN interface, users can directly communicate to devices over IPv6.

#### Ping specific devices ####
Users can ping devices using linux ping6 application and wfan0 interface

ping6 -I wfan0 `<ip address>`

## Feature and Architecture Summary ##

`wfantund` based on `wpantund` provides:

 *  ... a native IPv6 interface to an NCP.
 *  ... a command line interface (`wfanctl`) for managing and
    configuring the NCP.
 *  ... a DBus API for managing and configuring the NCP.
 *  ... a way to reliably manage the power state of the NCP.
 *  ... a uniform mechanism for handling NCP firmware updates.

The architecture and design of `wfantund` is based on `wpantund` which
has been motivated by the following design goals (in no specific order):

 *  Portability across Unix-like operating systems (currently supports
    Linux. BSD support should be fairly trivial to add)
 *  Require few runtime dependencies (DBus, with boost needed when
    building)
 *  Single-threaded architecture, with heavy use of asynchronous I/O
 *  Power efficiency (0% CPU usage when idle)
 *  Allow management interface to be used by multiple independent
    applications simultaneously
 *  Allow multiple instances of `wfantund` to gracefully co-exist on a
    single machine
 *  Modular, plugin-based architecture (all details for communicating
    with a specific NCP stack are implemented as plugins)

Note that Windows is not currently supported, but patches are welcome.

The following NCP plugins are provided:

*   `src/ncp-spinel`: Modified from those provided by `wpantund` to support
     TI Wi-SUN FAN Border Router. 
*   `src/ncp-dummy`: A dummy NCP plug-in implementation meant to be the
    starting point for implementing new NCP plug-ins



## Conceptual Overview ##

`wfantund` is based on `wpantund` and is conceptually similar in purpose to the point-to-point
daemon (`pppd`, commonly used on Unix platforms to provide network
connectivity via a dial-up modems) except that instead of communicating
with a dial-up modem, `wfantund` is communicating with an NCP.

`wfantund` communicates with the NCP via an abstraction of a
asynchronous stream socket, which could be any of the following:

 *  A real serial port (UART) connected to the NCP (preferably with
    hardware flow control)
 *  The stdin and stdout from a subprocess (for supporting SPI
    interfaces using a translator program or debugging virtual
    stacks)
 *  A TCP socket (for debugging, not recommended for production)

Unlike a dial-up modem, NCPs often have a rich management interface
for performing operations, such as forming a network, joining a
network, scanning for nearby networks, etc. To perform these operations,
`wfantund` includes a command line utility called `wfanctl`.
Applications that need to directly configure the network interface can
also communicate directly with `wfantund` using its DBus API.

To expose a native IPv6 network interface to the host operating
system, `wfantund` uses the `tun` driver on Linux. On Linux, the
default name for the interface is `wfan0`.




If compiled with `libreadline` or `libedit`, `wfanctl` supports an
convenient interactive console. All commands support online help: type
`help` to get a list of supported commands, or add `-h` to a command to get
help with that specific command.
